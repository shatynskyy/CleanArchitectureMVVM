🏗️ CleanArchitectureMVVM

Welcome to CleanArchitectureMVVM, a project dedicated to showcasing the principles of Clean Architecture and MVVM design pattern. While the emphasis is not on the UI, this project serves as a comprehensive example of software architecture best practices.

🧱 Clean Architecture Overview:
The project adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring a separation of concerns and maintainability. It consists of three main modules:

- Presentation: This module encapsulates the UI layer, containing activities, fragments, and view models. It interacts with the domain layer to present data to the user and handles user input and interactions.
- Domain: The domain module represents the business logic layer of the application. It contains entities, use cases, and interfaces defining the business rules and operations without being concerned about the data source or presentation details.
- Data: The data module deals with data access and manipulation, including database operations, network requests, and data mapping. It implements the interfaces defined in the domain layer and provides concrete implementations using frameworks like Room and Retrofit.

🚀 Key Technologies Used:
- Kotlin: The primary programming language driving the project.
- Hilt: Empowering dependency injection, ensuring cleaner and modular code.
- Coroutines and Flow: Handling asynchronous tasks seamlessly, enhancing responsiveness.
- Room: Providing a robust database solution for data management.
- Retrofit: Facilitating efficient API calls, ensuring smooth communication with backend services.
- Navigation Component: Simplifying navigation between different parts of the application.

📝 Project Details:
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of Clean Architecture principles and the MVVM design pattern. While UI elements are kept minimal, the focus lies on illustrating how various components interact within a well-structured architecture.

Happy coding! 🌟
